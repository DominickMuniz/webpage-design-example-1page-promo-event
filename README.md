Here are some screenshots of a beautifully designed webpage I created for a product-release event at PopSockets. This was originally created on Shopify using custom liquid code. Some of the sections were custom built, other sections had heavy modifications from the original/default styling and design they come with out the box. 




## The website was built with several breakpoints because it was a single page/landing page intended for our event. This event utilized Tablets, Desktops, and Mobile phones. We intentionally created specific breakpoints and positioning for each size. The following images show the design at different screen widths.
